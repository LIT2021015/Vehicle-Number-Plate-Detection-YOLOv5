# Vehicle-number-plate-recognition
Detect a vehicle number plate automatically and in addition to that extract the text and number from the detected number plate image using Optical character recognition(OCR). So it's a combination of both object detection using YOLOv5 and OCR(extract text from images).


# Result of object detection

In the above image, tesseract recognized the number wrongly as 4 for 1. Yes, Character recognition using OCR is not accurate.There is still lot needs to improve on image processing in future.
